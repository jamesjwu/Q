    index.js - Most reasonable routes
    metrics.js - Metrics related backend code
    users.js - Login related backend code, including authentication
```

### Miscellaneous
These files aren't included in the git repo, but are required for production:
coursePass.txt - md5 hashed course password
emailPass.txt - plaintext file with email password for email alerts
studentIDs.txt - plaintext list of student IDs in the course
TAAndrewIDs.txt - plaintext list of TA IDs in the course

These should be stored securely server side, with no way to access them publicly.
